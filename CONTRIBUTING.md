## Code Quality Standards

1.  **Write self-documenting code** - Use clear variable and function names in scripts and configuration files.
2.  **Add comments** for complex logic, especially in shell scripts or build system files.
3.  **Follow existing code style** - Maintain the formatting and patterns used in the existing codebase.
4.  **Write tests** - For new shell scripts or complex functionality, add validation or integration tests.
5.  **Update documentation** when adding new features or changing system configurations.

## Review Process

1.  All PRs require at least one approval before merging.
2.  Address all review comments before requesting a re-review.
3.  Keep PRs focused - one feature or fix per PR.
4.  Rebase your branch on the latest `main` before submitting to ensure a clean merge.

## Questions?

If you're unsure about anything related to Blue Archive Linux development, don't hesitate to ask in the issues or discussions section. Whether it's about maintaining minimalism, `bluepm` package management, or CLI-only configurations, we'd rather help you get it right than deal with unclear commits later!

Check the README for detailed information about using `bluepm` to install additional packages like GUI environments.
