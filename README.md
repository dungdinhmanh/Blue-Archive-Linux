# Blue Archive Linux

*A minimal, Blue Archive-themed Linux distribution for fans and power users.*

---

## 📌 Project Redirection Notice

**Blue Archive Linux is currently being rebuilt from the ground up.**

We're moving away from our original **Arch Linux** base to a **Debian-based** foundation while maintaining the spirit of Arch:
- 💡 Minimal first-boot system (CLI only)
- 🧰 You install what you need, how you want it
- 🎨 Easy to customize, especially for Blue Archive fans
- 🧼 Clean base, zero bloat

This is no longer just a themed distro — it's a flexible system designed for power users who want control *and* aesthetic.

---

## ⚙️ Current Status

- 🧱 **Base system:** Debian minimal (debootstrap-based)
- 🧪 **Current phase:** Early rebuilding
- 🖥️ **UI layer:** *Not included by default* — install KDE, XFCE, or anything you want
- 🎨 **Blue Archive themes and login (SDDM)**: Coming soon as opt-in packages
- 📦 **Package management:** APT (with `apt`, `tasksel`, optional Flatpak or Nala)

---

## 🔥 Philosophy

Inspired by Arch Linux, but based on Debian:
> *"Be simple, be clean, and give users the power to build their own perfect setup."*

### Goals:
- 💻 Minimal base CLI install
- 🎯 User-driven setup (like Arch's install scripts)
- 💙 Blue Archive themes, wallpapers, login screens, and branding as optional layers
- 🚀 Fast to install, easy to script
